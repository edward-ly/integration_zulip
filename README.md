# Zulip integration into Nextcloud

This integration is helpful in sending files to your Zulip workspace as original
files, public links to the files, or as internal Nextcloud links.

## üîß Configuration

### User settings

The account configuration happens in the "Connected accounts" user settings section.
It requires you to specify the URL of your Zulip instance
and the email address and API key
associated with your Zulip account in that instance.

If those settings are not configured,
A link to the "Connected accounts" user settings section will be displayed
when attempting to send a file to a Zulip channel/topic.
The context menu to send a file can be accessed
by right clicking on the file/folder to be shared
or selecting them and clicking on the "Actions" button.
